Build a fully responsive, modern portfolio website for Pratik Bhure, a MERN Stack Developer, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind).
The site must be impactful, professional, user-friendly, animated, and mobile-responsive.

Create separate files for clarity:

index.html
css/style.css
js/script.js
assets/images/   (for profile photo, project images, icons)

🔹 General Design System
